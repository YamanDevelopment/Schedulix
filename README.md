## Description

Schedulix is a program that helps university students develop their course schedules for their upcoming semester. It takes in the user's preferences and generates multiple schedules that fit the user's preferences. The program is written in JavaScript and uses the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment. 

## Inspiration

Having to make our college schedule while being dually enrolled in high school is such a pain especially having to consider so many variables, so we thought why not be able to automate this all the while still keeping our meticulous preferences in our schedule and on top of that give us multiple options to choose from. Multiple choice schedules perfect for everyone!

## [Algorithm](src/backend/README.md)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `node main.js` in the terminal (uses hardcoded preferences)
3. Currently, the program hardcodes the preferences, but it will be updated to take user input in the future
