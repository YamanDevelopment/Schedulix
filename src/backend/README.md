# Algorithm

## 1. **Input:**

- **Desired Courses:** Courses the student wants to take.
- **Unavailable Times:** Days and hours when the student does not want to have classes.

## 2. **Data Preparation:**

- Organize the course data in a way that includes information about course timings and durations.
- Convert the user input (desired courses and unavailable times) into a format suitable for comparison with the course data.

## 3. **Constraint Modeling:**

- **Temporal Constraints:**
  - Ensure that the class timings don't overlap with the times the student is unavailable.
- **Course Constraints:**
  - Match the student's desired courses with the available courses.

## 4. **Backtracking Algorithm:**

Implement a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible combinations of schedules based on the constraints:

- **Variables:** Each variable represents a course the student can take.
- **Domain:** For each variable, the domain represents all possible time slots the course can be scheduled in.
- **Constraints:** Apply the temporal constraints and course constraints during the search process.

## 5. **Backtracking Steps:**

- **Base Case:**
  - If all courses are scheduled and constraints are met, return the current schedule as a solution.
- **Recursive Step:**
  - Pick an unscheduled course variable.
  - Iterate through its possible time slots (domain values).
  - For each time slot, check if it satisfies temporal constraints.
  - If a valid slot is found, move to the next course variable recursively.
- **Backtrack:**
  - If no valid slot is found for a course variable, backtrack to the previous variable and try a different time slot.

## 6. **Output:**

Once all possible schedules have been explored, present the valid schedules to the user.

## Notes

- Ensure the algorithm considers both course constraints and the unavailable times specified by the user.
- It's essential to handle cases where no valid schedule can be generated due to conflicting constraints.
- Validate the algorithm with various input scenarios to ensure correctness and efficiency.

This algorithm works similarly to the one described earlier, but with a focus on incorporating the user's specific course preferences and unavailable times. By following these steps, you can create a schedule solver that generates personalized schedules for students based on their desired courses and availability constraints.
